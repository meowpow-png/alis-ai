# üìñ Contributing to Alis AI

## Overview
This document outlines the best practices for contributing to Alis AI‚Äôs instruction set.  
It ensures all updates follow a structured Git workflow, maintaining version control and consistency.

---

## Git Workflow

This project uses a structured Git workflow optimized for clarity, instruction versioning, changelog automation, and component-level traceability.

---

### Branching Strategy

All work must be done on topic branches and merged into `develop`.

| Branch             | Purpose                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `main`             | Stable, production-ready releases            |
| `develop`          | Integration branch for active changes        |
| `release/alis-vx.x`| Release staging, review, and version bumping |
| `comp/<component>` | Component-scoped work                        |

> üîç Use the `comp/` prefix to indicate branches tied to specific components or instruction systems.  
> Example branches:
> - `comp/developer-mode`
> - `comp/export-diff-preview`
> - `comp/validation-error-reporting`
---

### Commit Message Guidelines

Alis expects commit messages to follow a clear, readable structure optimized for user-facing changelogs and traceable version history.

#### Format

Each commit should follow this structure:

```
<Type>: <Short, imperative summary>

<Optional detailed description explaining what changed and why>
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **The colon (`:`) after the prefix is required.**  
> Commit messages that omit it will not be considered valid.

---

#### Prefixes

Allowed prefixes are all **imperative-phrased** and directly mapped to changelog categories.

| Prefix         | Mapped Category       | Purpose                                             |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `Add:`         | üÜï Features             | Introduce new behaviors, components, or logic       |
| `Implement:`   | üÜï Features             | Implement full systems or capabilities              |
| `Integrate:`   | üÜï Features             | Integrate new subsystems or external functionality  |
| `Fix:`         | üêõ Fixes                | Resolve bugs, unintended behavior                   |
| `Resolve:`     | üêõ Fixes                | Same as `Fix:`, alternate phrasing                  |
| `Refactor:`    | üîÅ Refactoring          | Reorganize code/structure without behavior change   |
| `Rename:`      | üîÅ Refactoring          | Rename files, functions, sections                   |
| `Remove:`      | üîÅ Refactoring          | Remove unused or redundant parts                    |
| `Drop:`        | üîÅ Refactoring          | Forcefully remove deprecated logic or features      |
| `Rewrite:`     | üîÅ Refactoring          | Rewrite logic or structure                          |
| `Reword:`      | üîÅ Refactoring          | Adjust textual content or phrasing without behavior change |
| `Write:`       | üìö Documentation        | Create or significantly expand documentation        |
| `Clarify:`     | üìö Documentation        | Refine or correct documentation wording             |
| `Test:`        | ‚úÖ Tests                | Add or improve tests                                |
| `Optimize:`    | üöÄ Optimization         | Enhance performance, efficiency, or clarity         |
| `Improve:`     | üöÄ Optimization         | General improvements in logic or flow               |

> üîê All prefixes **must include a colon (`:`)**.  
> Example: `Implement: instruction export flow logic`

Alis uses this prefix mapping to classify changelog entries during generation.

---

**Guidelines for Prefix Usage:**

- ‚úÖ All prefixes must be used with a colon (e.g., `Fix:`, not `Fix`)
- ‚úÖ Choose the prefix that best matches the **type of change**, not just the file touched
- ‚úÖ All prefixes must be **imperative verbs**
- ‚úÖ Commit summaries should describe **what changed**, not why ‚Äî use the body for rationale
- ‚úÖ If a negating verb is used (`skip`, `remove`, `disable`), be sure to clarify what was added, changed, or replaced

---

#### Writing Commit Messages

- ‚úÖ Use **imperative mood** in the summary  
  (e.g., `Add: validate-instructions dry-run mode`, not `Added` or `Adding`)
- ‚úÖ Keep the **summary line as short as possible without losing necessary context**
  - Recommended: under 50 characters
  - Maximum: 72 characters
- ‚úÖ Use the body (description) to elaborate on conditions, motivations, or technical implications if needed
- ‚úÖ Each commit message should describe **one change**, clearly
- ‚úÖ **Do not reuse** the same message for multiple commits, even if similar
- ‚úÖ Describe **what** was done in the subject, and **why** in the body (if applicable)

---

#### Linking Issues or Related Work

Use [GitHub-compatible references](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls#issues-and-pull-requests) in commit bodies when referencing related issues, features, or discussions.

```
Fix: incorrect instruction file validation order

Fixes #42 ‚Äî behavior mismatch during export generation.
```

---

#### Fix Commits

- `Fix:` commits must **always reference a GitHub issue** (e.g., `Fixes #123`)
- The issue should describe the full problem and context
- The commit should contain a **brief summary** of the resolution only

---

#### Avoid

- Vague summaries like `Fix things`, `Update`, or `Misc edits`
- Mixing unrelated changes into a single commit
- Passive/log-style prefixes (`Rename`, `Resolve`) without a colon
- Omitting the prefix colon (e.g., `Fix something` instead of `Fix: something`)

---

#### Rewriting Commit History

You may **squash, amend, or rewrite** commits during a feature's development.  
However, if you change any commit messages **after a changelog was generated**,  
you must **regenerate the entire changelog** for the affected release.

Why?

- Alis links changelog entries to Git history and expects them to match
- Outdated messages or missing links may invalidate changelog grouping or summaries

---

#### Examples

```
Fix: correct diff marker formatting in preview table

Fixes #87 ‚Äî incorrect '+' symbol applied to changed lines.
```

```
Add: structured output changelog support
```

```
Docs: clarify reinforcement rule formatting behavior
```

---

### Release Workflow

1. Create your branch from `develop` using a component-focused slug
2. Make and commit changes following message format
3. Push your branch
4. Merge into `develop`
5. When preparing a release, create a `release/alis-vx.x` branch
6. Open a PR from the release branch to `main`

> üîê PRs are only required for release branches

-> Final Production Release
```

- üß† `develop`: Ongoing changes and staging for releases
- üß© `feature/component`: Localized feature or fix work
- üöÄ `release/alis-vx.x`: Polish, finalize, bump version, changelog generation
- ‚úÖ `main`: Stable, final release-ready instruction state

#### Pull Request Format

**Pull request title:**

```
Release: <fun, themed name>
```

> Example:  
> `Release: Command Core`

- Must begin with `Release:`
- Should include a creative, symbolic, or informative name for the release
- Alis will assist in naming based on components and features included

**Pull Request description:**

```
- Version: vX.Y
- Summary: <brief description of what this release introduces>
- Includes: <list of components or major features>
- Linked Issues: #<issue>, #<issue> (optional)
```

> Example:
```
- Version: v1.0  
- Summary: Introduces Developer Mode with controlled instruction export and verification  
- Includes: developer-mode, export-diff-preview, validator  
- Linked Issues: #24, #33
```

---

#### Requirements for Merging

- Must pass `validate-instructions`
- Should optionally run a changelog dry-run for preview
- A proper `CHANGELOG.md` entry must be generated and committed
- Alis will assist with release naming, formatting, and changelog updates

> ‚ùó Do not merge release branches directly into `main` ‚Äî always use a PR

---

### Merge Commit Guidelines

Merge commits are used when merging a fully implemented component or finalized release branch into a target branch (`develop` or `main`).

**Format:**

```
Merge: <component/system name>

- <Prefix>: <summary of meaningful commits>
- <Prefix>: ...
```

**Guidelines:**

- Use `Merge:` as the commit title prefix
- The title must summarize what is being merged (e.g., the name of the component or system)
- Each bullet in the body must follow the commit prefix rules from this document
- Use **imperative** phrasing in all bullet lines
- Bullet points must describe *what was done*, not *why*

**Example:**

```
Merge: developer-mode instruction framework

- Implement: Developer Mode toggle via CLI
- Add: export step control logic (skip, abort, confirm)
- Add: commit draft generation logic
- Add: import-mode formatting for export
- Refactor: remove outdated Export Workflow section
- Fix: nested markdown formatting in prompt previews
- Optimize: reduce verbosity in export prompts
```

> üß† Merge commits must always be written manually and follow the same commit prefix validation logic as standard commits.

---

### Release Process

- All release PRs must be made from a `release/alis-vx.x` branch to `main`
- All commits merged into `main` **must** be validated first via:
  - ‚úÖ `validate-instructions` (Alis will enforce structure and consistency)
  - ‚öôÔ∏è Optionally: Run a changelog dry-run to preview generated output

---

### Changelog

Alis can generate structured changelogs automatically based on Git commit history and project metadata.

This system ensures user-facing changes are grouped clearly by component and categorized for readability.

---

#### Automation Behavior

Alis reads commit history on the current `release/alis-vX.X` branch and cross-references:
- Commit messages
- Changed file paths
- Component metadata (via `component-metadata.yaml`)

Entries are grouped by **category** and **component**, and output in clean, readable markdown format.

> Example:
>
> ```
> Commit: Add: export skip and abort step logic
> Files: src/developer-mode.md
> ```
>
> Will generate:
>
> ### üÜï Features  
> #### üß© Developer Mode  
> - Add: export skip and abort step logic

---

#### Changelog Categories

The following changelog categories are supported and used to group entries:

| Category        | Description                                                       |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üÜï Features      | New functionality, capabilities, or user-facing systems           |
| üêõ Fixes         | Bug fixes and unintended behavior corrections                     |
| üîÅ Refactoring   | Reorganization, renaming, or structure changes without new logic  |
| üìö Documentation | User-facing documentation updates or additions                    |
| ‚úÖ Tests         | Additions or improvements to testing logic                        |
| üöÄ Optimization  | Performance, efficiency, clarity, or reliability improvements     |

Alis maps these categories from commit prefix rules defined in this document.  
Component grouping is determined by file-to-component mappings in `component-metadata.yaml`.
