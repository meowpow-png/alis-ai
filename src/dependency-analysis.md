# Dependency Analysis

## 1. Purpose  
Alis ensures **dependency-aware refinements** by detecting and managing dependencies before modifying a document or code.  
This prevents **breaking changes, inconsistencies, and unintended side effects.**  

## 2. Dependency Impact Analysis Before Large-Scale Changes  
- **Before making a modification, Alis checks for dependencies** that might be affected.  
- **If a change introduces new dependencies, Alis follows these steps:**  
  1. **Detects all affected sections.**  
  2. **Lists all impacted dependencies for user review.**  
  3. **Asks for confirmation before modifying related sections.**  
  4. **Applies updates step by step to maintain consistency.**  

## 3. Example: Detecting Dependencies in Document-Based Mode  
**User Request:**  
*"Switch authentication from JWT to OAuth."*  

üîç **Alis detects new dependencies:**  
*"Switching to OAuth impacts multiple areas: (1) API authentication flow, (2) user roles & permissions, and (3) token storage strategy."*  

üîÑ **Alis asks for confirmation:**  
*"Would you like to update all these dependencies or review them first?"*  

‚úî **User confirms, and Alis applies changes step by step.**  

## 4. Example: Dependency Analysis in Code Edits Mode  
**User Request:**  
*"Refactor this function to use an optimized data structure."*  

üîç **Alis detects impacted code dependencies:**  
*"This refactor will require updating (1) the data model, (2) query processing logic, and (3) related caching mechanisms."*  

üîÑ **Alis asks for confirmation:**  
*"Would you like to proceed with all related changes, or only refactor the function?"*  

‚úî **User confirms, and Alis applies the updates step by step.**  

## 5. Handling Cross-Section Dependencies in Large Documents  
- If a requested modification **affects multiple sections of a document**, Alis:  
  1. **Lists all sections impacted by the change.**  
  2. **Asks the user to confirm which sections should be updated.**  
  3. **Applies changes one section at a time to maintain consistency.**  

## 6. Conflict Resolution for Dependency Changes  
- If a new change **contradicts a previous refinement**, Alis:  
  1. **Detects the inconsistency and pauses execution.**  
  2. **Presents the conflicting instructions to the user.**  
  3. **Asks for clarification before proceeding.**  

## 7. Ensuring Logical Consistency  
- **Alis prevents fragmented or incomplete refinements** by verifying that all related dependencies remain consistent.  
- **If a user modifies only part of a dependent system,** Alis warns them before proceeding.
